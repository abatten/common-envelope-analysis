[Common Section]

#### The path where the data directories are stored.
#### NOTE: root_dir should only contain output directories
root_dir:/disks/ceres/makemake/acomp/jstaff/raijin/enzoamr-2.3/1Moz0.02late-2/128/4levels/2part/run210Mj/

#### The directories in root_dir to exclude from the analysis. Seperate by ,
#### Put NONE for no directories.
exclude_dir:1part 

#### The path where the plots and output files will be written. Ensure it ends with a /
plot_dir:/disks/ceres/makemake/acomp/abatten/jstaff/sim2/plots/

#### Number to start counding from in path.
initial_path:0

#### The number of directories to be analysed.
#### Plus one to match with python range functions
final_path_plus_one:1


[Damping Analysis Section]

#### If the data from all the directories is to be stored
global_storage:False 


[Energy Section]

#### The name of the output file
output_file_name:energy_components.txt

#### Selects if you want to keep writing in the tail of a previous file with the
#### name as specified in "output_file_name" or you want to create a new one
#### from scratch (0 = OVERWRITE, 1 = APPEND)
output_file_append:0

#### Use or not the smoothed potential to compute potential energies involving
#### particles (0 = NO, 1 = YES)
use_smoothed_potential:1

#### Smoothing length in number of cells (only used if "use_smoothed_potential = 1")
smoothing_length:3.0
