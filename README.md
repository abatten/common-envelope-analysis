# Common Envelope Analysis
These scripts are the scripts I wrote as a part of my 
Masters of Research at Macquarie University. 

They have been written using YT libraries and have been 
specifically used to analyse the output of an ENZO 
common envelope simulation.

### Prerequisites
[YT](http://yt-project.org/): A Python package to used to display astrphysical simulation data.  

Installation instructions can be found [here](http://yt-project.org/docs/2.6/installing.html)


`pip install numpy matplotlib configparser`
